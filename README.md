# KPI-report-automation-
The KPI report automation is purposely made to allow the automation of PowerPoint Presentation export through downloads reducing time spent in manually designing them. 

The three main features are as follows;
Create a dash board
View realtime KPIs 
Export KPI reports
Automated PowerPoint Presentation (Ppt) through one click downloads

To accurately test out the KPI report generator, it important to install all libraries as listed in the main.py code branch using the "pip install library name" command in the terminal of VS code, jupyter notebook among other programming platforms. 

Ensure that subprocess is installed because it allows us to export vectorized ppt graphs making them more conducive for presentations.

Lastly, two inputs are used to derive the solutions which are data file and the pre-edited ppt file with place holders that can be moved according to preference.
